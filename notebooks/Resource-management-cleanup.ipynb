    "## Shutting down notebook instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook instances in SageMaker are billed per hour, so it’s essential to stop or delete them when they are no longer needed. Earlier in the **Notebooks as controllers** episode, we discussed using lower-cost instance types like `ml.t3.medium` (approximately $0.05/hour) for controlling workflows. While this makes open notebooks less costly than larger instances, it’s still a good habit to stop or delete notebooks to avoid unnecessary spending, especially if left idle for long periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to SageMaker in the AWS Console.**\n",
    "2. In the left-hand menu, click **Notebooks**.\n",
    "3. Locate your notebook instance and select it.\n",
    "4. Choose **Stop** to shut it down temporarily or **Delete** to permanently remove it.\n",
    "   > **Tip:** If you plan to reuse the notebook later, stopping it is sufficient. Deleting is recommended if you are finished with the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning up S3 storage\n",
    "\n",
    "While S3 storage is relatively inexpensive, cleaning up unused buckets and files helps keep costs minimal and your workspace organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to the S3 Console.**\n",
    "2. Locate the bucket(s) you created for this workshop.\n",
    "3. Open the bucket and select any objects (files) you no longer need.\n",
    "4. Click **Delete** to remove the selected objects.\n",
    "5. To delete an entire bucket:\n",
    "   - Empty the bucket by selecting **Empty bucket** under **Bucket actions**.\n",
    "   - Delete the bucket by clicking **Delete bucket**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reminder:** Earlier in the workshop, we set up tags for S3 buckets. Use these tags to filter and identify workshop-related buckets, ensuring that only unnecessary resources are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monitoring and stopping active jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker charges for training and tuning jobs while they run, so make sure to terminate unused jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the SageMaker Console, go to **Training Jobs** or **Tuning Jobs**.\n",
    "2. Identify any active jobs that you no longer need.\n",
    "3. Select the jobs and click **Stop**.\n",
    "   > **Tip:** Review the job logs to ensure you’ve saved the results before stopping a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Billing and cost monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing your AWS expenses is vital to staying within budget. Follow these steps to monitor and control costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up billing alerts:**\n",
    "   - Go to the AWS **Billing Dashboard**.\n",
    "   - Navigate to **Budgets** and create a budget alert to track your spending.\n",
    "2. **Review usage and costs:**\n",
    "   - Use the AWS **Cost Explorer** in the Billing Dashboard to view detailed expenses by service, such as SageMaker and S3.\n",
    "3. **Use tags for cost tracking:**\n",
    "   - Refer to the tags you set up earlier in the workshop for your notebooks and S3 buckets. These tags help you identify and monitor costs associated with specific resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices for resource management\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient resource management can save significant costs and improve your workflows. Below are some best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate resource cleanup:**\n",
    "   Use AWS SDK or CLI scripts to automatically shut down instances and clean up S3 buckets when not in use. [Learn more about automation with AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html).\n",
    "- **Schedule resource usage:**\n",
    "   Schedule instance start and stop times using AWS Lambda. [Learn how to schedule tasks with AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events.html).\n",
    "- **Test workflows locally first:**\n",
    "   Before scaling up experiments in SageMaker, test them locally to minimize cloud usage and costs. [Learn about SageMaker local mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/hosting-alternatives.html).\n",
    "- **Use cost tracking tools:**\n",
    "   Explore AWS’s cost allocation tags and budget tracking features. [Learn more about cost management in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these practices and leveraging the additional resources provided, you can optimize your use of AWS while keeping costs under control.\n",
    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always stop or delete notebook instances when not in use to avoid charges.\n",
    "- Regularly clean up unused S3 buckets and objects to save on storage costs.\n",
    "- Monitor your expenses through the AWS Billing Dashboard and set up alerts.\n",
    "- Use tags (set up earlier in the workshop) to track and monitor costs by resource.\n",
    "- Following best practices for AWS resource management can significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency.\n",
