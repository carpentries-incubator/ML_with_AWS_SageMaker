    "### New Cloud Stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several general approaches for setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow on AWS, each suited to different scales and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use long-lived inference endpoints for online RAG workloads.** For applications that need low-latency, interactive RAG (APIs, chatbots, dashboards), you can deploy your own embedding and generation models as SageMaker inference endpoints (or Bedrock-like managed endpoints) and call them from your retrieval service. This gives you control over the model, scaling policies, and autoscaling, but it’s also the most expensive option if traffic is low or bursty, since you’re keeping capacity online even when no one is querying the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run everything inside a single GPU-backed notebook instance**\n",
    "For small- to medium-sized models (< 8 B), it's often simplest to just pick a GPU instance (e.g., [p3.2xlarge](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/ML_with_AWS_SageMaker/instances-for-ML.html)), load your embedding and generation models directly in the notebook, and run RAG end-to-end there. This keeps the architecture simple and avoids extra moving parts, as long as you're disciplined about shutting down the instance when you’re done so you don’t leak cost. It's also possible to do this with larger models, but the costs to use more powerful GPUs (e.g., $15/hour) may be a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use SageMaker Estimators to run batch jobs for embeddings and/or generation.**\n",
    "For large corpora or workflows where you want repeatable, offline computation, you can treat parts of the RAG pipeline—especially embedding—like a batch processing job rather than a live model. Instead of deploying an inference endpoint, you run a short-lived Hugging Face Estimator job that spins up a GPU instance, loads your embedding or generation model, processes all the chunked text in one shot, and saves the results back to S3. This pattern is ideal for “compute once, use many times” workloads, such as generating embeddings for thousands of documents or producing long-form outputs that don’t require low latency. Because the Estimator only exists while the batch completes, you avoid the continuous cost of an always-on endpoint. However, this approach is not suited for per-query RAG retrieval—launching an Estimator per user request would be far too slow, since starting a training job can take several minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Amazon Bedrock for managed embedding and generation APIs.** If you prefer fully managed foundation models and don’t want to own model hosting at all, Bedrock lets you call embedding and generation models via API from your RAG pipeline. You still manage your vector store and retrieval logic (for example in Lambda, ECS, or SageMaker), but you outsource the heavy model lifecycle work—at the trade-off of less control over architectures and sometimes higher per-token cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer factual questions from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*. Our long-term goal is to build a RAG-powered chatbot that supports literary exploration—helping readers investigate character dynamics, thematic development, and emotional subtext.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the demo, we focus on low-hanging fruit: factual, quote-supported questions that a RAG pipeline can answer reliably. These examples will help us introduce key RAG components, and set a performance baseline before tackling more interpretive questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the key components of a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
    "- Use a sentence-transformer model to create embeddings from text passages.\n",
    "- Run simple retrieval using vector similarity and evaluate retrieved chunks.\n",
    "- Generate answers to factual questions using retrieved content as context.\n",
    "- Understand early limitations of RAG pipelines and motivate future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the corpus**\n",
    "   - We use Shakespeare texts from the workshop's `data.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split text into chunks**\n",
    "   - Long texts are broken into smaller passages (~200 words) so they're easier to search and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create embeddings**\n",
    "   - Each chunk is converted into a vector — a mathematical representation of its meaning — using a pretrained model from `sentence-transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve relevant chunks**\n",
    "   - When you ask a question, we embed the question and compare it to the embedded text chunks to find the most similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ask a language model**\n",
    "   - We take the most relevant passages and feed them (along with your question) into a pretrained language model (like GPT-2) to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not training a model from scratch — it's a lightweight, modular way to build smart question-answering tools on top of your own text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the strengths and limitations of this approach along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Load the corpus\n",
    "In this example, we'll use \"Romeo and Juliet\" as our text corpus. This text is freely available via [Project Gutenberg](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Toolbox/Data/Gutenberg.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "To enable semantic search, we need to convert our text chunks into numerical vectors—high-dimensional representations that capture meaning beyond simple keyword overlap. This process is called *embedding*, and it allows us to compare the semantic similarity between a user's question and the contents of a document.\n",

    "This is done using an **encoder-only transformer model**. Unlike decoder or encoder-decoder models, encoder-only models are not designed to generate text. Instead, they are optimized for understanding input sequences and producing meaningful vector representations. These models take in text and output fixed-size embeddings that capture semantic content—ideal for tasks like search, retrieval, and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/) library  \n",
    "  - A widely used library that wraps encoder-only transformer models for generating sentence- and paragraph-level embeddings.\n",
    "  - It provides a simple interface (`model.encode()`) and is optimized for performance and batching, making it well-suited for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.\n",
    "  - It supports both short queries and longer document chunks, embedding them into the same shared vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pretrained model: [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1)  \n",
    "  - A compact encoder-only model (6 layers) designed for semantic search and question answering.\n",
    "  - Trained using contrastive learning on query-passage pairs, so it learns to embed related questions and answers close together in vector space.\n",
    "  - It's efficient enough to run on CPUs or entry-level GPUs, making it great for experimentation and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why embeddings matter in RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In a RAG system, embeddings are the foundation for connecting a user's question to the most relevant content in your corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on exact keyword matches, embeddings represent both queries and document chunks in the same semantic space. When a user asks a question, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the user's question into a vector using the same encoder-only embedding model that was used to encode the document chunks.\n",
    "2. Compute similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity) between the query vector and each chunk vector.\n",
    "3. Retrieve the top-matching chunks to pass along as context to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the system to surface text that is meaningfully related to the question—even if it doesn't use the same words. For example, a question like \"*What does Juliet think of Romeo?*\" might retrieve a passage describing her inner turmoil or emotional reaction, even if the words \"think\" or \"Romeo\" aren't explicitly present. Embedding-based retrieval improves relevance, flexibility, and ultimately the quality of the answers your language model can generate."

    "After generating embeddings, you need a way to perform fast similarity search. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a popular open-source library from Meta for efficient vector search and nearest-neighbor lookup; it works well when your whole index can fit in memory and you're running retrieval inside a notebook or small API. For larger or multi-user systems, you might use a managed vector database instead. These become useful when you need concurrent queries, metadata filtering, persistent storage, or indexes that exceed a single machine’s memory. In those cases, OpenSearch with k-NN, Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector, or Bedrock Knowledge Bases can provide scalable vector search at the cost of additional setup and ongoing management. For most projects, storing `embeddings.npy` in S3 and using FAISS or a similar local index is usually enough, especially when the corpus is small and you mainly need retrieval inside a notebook or simple API."

This assumption holds reasonably well for general-purpose models trained on sentence pairs, but it's not perfect — especially for very abstract or indirect questions. If a model was only trained to embed statements, it may not align questions correctly. You might retrieve chunks that are **related but not directly useful** for answering the question."

    "  * \"*Which way ran he that kild Mercutio? Tibalt that Murtherer, which way ran he?*\". Despite the archaic spelling and phrasing, this chunk effectively provides the answer when interpreted in context.\n",

    "  * \"*Tibalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a Letter*\" ... \"*A challenge on my life*\". While it doesn't answer the question directly, it reinforces that Tibalt is the antagonist and establishes his role in escalating the violence.\n",

    "  * \"*Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutios Friend… The life of Tibalt*.\" The Prince confirms that Tybalt (Tibalt) has been killed in consequence of Mercutio's death. This chunk emphasizes closure rather than causality, but still supports the factual chain.\n",

    "### Improving retrieved chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to having a language model generate answers, we need to take a closer look at the quality of the retrieved content.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just saw, our current retrieval method brings back passages that are topically related but often miss the actual moment where the answer appears. In some cases, the correct chunk is nearby but not retrieved. In others, key information may be split across multiple chunks or surrounded by distracting dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we'll focus on a key area of improvement: **refining the chunking strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why chunking matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The current approach uses a simple method such as splitting the text by a fixed word count. While this works for general purposes, it often cuts across meaningful dramatic units:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A character's speech may be interrupted mid-line\n",
    "- A fight scene may be split just before or after a critical action\n",
    "- A conversation between characters may be split across chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to less coherent retrieval and lowers the chance that a single chunk can fully answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two practical adjustments we can use to improve the retrievals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group complete speaker turns into chunks**: Instead of arbitrary lengths, we can group text based on who is speaking. This ensures each chunk preserves the flow and tone of the conversation.\n",
    "2. **Use scene- or event-aware chunking**: By chunking based on scene boundaries or key events (e.g. \"Romeo kills Tybalt\"), we improve the chance that retrieved content captures complete dramatic moments, not just pieces of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes don't require a new model—they just help the existing model work with more meaningful input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll apply dialogue-aware chunking and rerun one of our earlier factual queries to see whether the results improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refining chunking strategy\n",
    "Our current chunks are only based on word length. Instead, we can create chunks that are more tuned to the dataset and potential questions we might ask by defining a chunk as a \"dialogue block\", i.e.,  as a group of N full speaker turns (e.g., JULIET. + her lines, ROMEO. + his lines, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give this a shot to see how it impacts retrieval."

    "### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Refining our chunking strategy to preserve full speaker turns—and grouping several turns together—has already improved the relevance of the chunks retrieved. The content is more coherent, more complete, and better aligned with the structure of a play. This shows how much retrieval quality depends not just on the model, but on the way we prepare and represent the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, even with better chunks, retrieval doesn't always land on the exact moment that answers the question. Sometimes it gets close but stops short; other times it picks up a scene with similar characters or themes, but not the one we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "This points to a deeper challenge: *semantic similarity alone doesn't always capture answer relevance*. The chunk that's closest in meaning isn't always the one that answers the question. One way to address this is through a process called **reranking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is reranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking means retrieving a small set of candidate chunks—say, the top 5—and then using an additional method to determine which of those is the best fit for the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "That method could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A custom scoring function (e.g., based on keyword overlap, speaker identity, or chunk metadata),\n",
    "- Or—more powerfully—a *separate language model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separate model can be small or large, depending on your resource availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A smaller open-source model (like `mistral`, `falcon`, or `phi`) can often handle basic ranking tasks at low cost.\n",
    "- A larger LLM (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) may be better at reasoning through subtleties and weighing relevance when answers are indirect or distributed across lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask this model something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are three passages. Which one best answers the question: \"Who kills Mercutio?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, it might feel strange to use one language model to support another—but this layered setup is common in production RAG pipelines. It separates concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The retriever quickly narrows down the universe of text,\n",
    "- The reranker evaluates those chunks more deeply, focusing on which is most likely to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't implement this yet, but it's worth introducing now. As we start exploring more ambiguous or emotionally driven questions in later sections, reranking becomes one of the key techniques for bridging the gap between retrieval and meaningful response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we've established a strong foundation: well-structured chunks that carry clear speaker information and preserve narrative flow. That's a critical step toward building a RAG system that doesn't just respond, but interprets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrading our retrieval model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we've used so far, [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1), is a solid starting point for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, it is relatively lightweight (22M parameters, ~500–800 MB GPU memory), which makes it efficient but less expressive than larger models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, larger embedding models have more capacity to capture subtle semantic relationships, including indirect phrasing or domain-specific language. This can make a dramatic difference in tasks like matching Shakespearean dialogue to modern questions—something smaller models often struggle with.\n",
    "\n",

    "This happens because decoder-only models are trained to predict the *next token given all previous tokens*, not to separate a prompt from a response. So when you pass in a prompt, the model simply continues generating text — it doesn't know where \"input\" ends and \"output\" begins.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook introduced a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for factual question answering using *Romeo and Juliet*. The goal was to build a simple but functioning system and surface practical lessons about how to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For retrieval**, we explored and discussed improvements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using stronger embedding models (e.g., upgrading from `MiniLM` to `all-mpnet-base-v2`).\n",
    "- Adopting a question-aligned chunking strategy, where chunks were grouped by speaker turns to better match the structure of expected queries.\n",
    "- Implementing cosine similarity retrieval, which better handles variation in chunk lengths and embedding magnitudes.\n",
    "- Briefly mentioning reranking as a next step, though not yet implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For generation**, we found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instruction-tuned language models yield more precise and context-sensitive answers.\n",
    "- Prompt formatting significantly affects the clarity and relevance of the generated output.\n",
    "- Post-processing may be necessary for trimming or cleaning model responses, especially in short-form QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While larger models consistently improve both retrieval and generation, thoughtful design choices—such as aligning chunk structure to question types, using the right embedding normalization, and writing effective prompts—can yield substantial gains, even in smaller pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a first step in a broader RAG workflow. Future notebooks will experiment with more flexible chunking, incorporate reranking, and test the system’s ability to handle interpretive or subjective questions.\n",
