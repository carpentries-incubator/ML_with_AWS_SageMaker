This is helpful for machine learning jobs that require extra power, GPUs, or benefit from parallelization. However, before we try exploiting this extra power, it is essential that we test our code thoroughly! We don't want to waste unnecessary compute cycles and resources on jobs that produce bugs rather than insights. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before scaling to mutliple or more powerful instances (e.g., training on larger/multiple datsets in parallel or tuning hyperparameters in parallel), it's important to run a few quick sanity checks to catch potential issues early. **In your group, discuss:**  \n",

    "Which checks do you think are most critical before scaling up?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data loads correctly** – Ensure the dataset loads without errors, expected columns exist, and missing values are handled properly.  \n",
    "- **Overfitting check** – Train on a small dataset (e.g., 100 rows). If it doesn't overfit, there may be a data or model setup issue.  \n",
    "- **Loss behavior check** – Verify that training loss decreases over time and doesn't diverge.  \n",
    "- **Training time estimate** – Run on a small subset to estimate how long full training will take.\n",
    "- **Memory estimate** - Estimate the memory needs of the algorithm/model you're using, and understand how this scales with input size.\n",

    "### Understanding the XGBoost Training Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to review the `AWS_helpers/train_xgboost.py` script we just cloned into our notebook. This script handles preprocessing, training, and saving an XGBoost model, while also adapting to both local and SageMaker-managed environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: What transformations are applied to the dataset before training?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Function**: What does the `train_model()` function do? Why do we print the training time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command-Line Arguments**: What is the purpose of `argparse` in this script? How would you modify the script if you wanted to change the number of training rounds?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Local vs. SageMaker Runs**: How does the script determine whether it is running in a SageMaker training job or locally (within this notebook's instance)?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training and Saving the Model**: What format is the dataset converted to before training, and why? How is the trained model saved, and where will it be stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing, discuss any questions or observations with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: The script fills missing values (`Age` with median, `Embarked` with mode), converts categorical variables (`Sex` and `Embarked`) to numerical values, and removes columns that don't contribute to prediction (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Function**: The `train_model()` function takes the training dataset (`dtrain`), applies XGBoost training with the specified hyperparameters, and prints the training time. Printing training time helps compare different runs and ensures that scaling decisions are based on performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command-Line Arguments**: `argparse` allows passing parameters like `max_depth`, `eta`, `num_round`, etc., at runtime without modifying the script. To change the number of training rounds, you would update the `--num_round` argument when running the script:  `python train_xgboost.py --num_round 200`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Local vs. SageMaker Runs**: The script uses `os.environ.get(\"SM_CHANNEL_TRAIN\", \".\")` and `os.environ.get(\"SM_MODEL_DIR\", \".\")` to detect whether it’s running in SageMaker. `SM_CHANNEL_TRAIN` is the directory where SageMaker stores input training data, and `SM_MODEL_DIR` is the directory where trained models should be saved. If these environment variables are *not set* (e.g., running locally), the script defaults to `\".\"` (current directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training and Saving the Model**: The dataset is converted into **XGBoost's `DMatrix` format**, which is optimized for memory and computation efficiency. The trained model is saved using `joblib.dump()` to `xgboost-model`, stored either in the SageMaker `SM_MODEL_DIR` (if running in SageMaker) or in the local directory.\n",

Here's a breakdown of some commonly used Estimator classes in SageMaker:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`Estimator` (Base Class)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: General-purpose for custom Docker containers or defining an image URI directly.\n",
    "   - **Configuration**: Requires specifying an `image_uri` and custom entry points.\n",
    "   - **Dependencies**: You can use `requirements.txt` to install Python packages or configure a custom Docker container with pre-baked dependencies.\n",
    "   - **Ideal Use Cases**: Custom algorithms or models that need tailored environments not covered by built-in containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`XGBoost` Estimator**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Provides an optimized container specifically for XGBoost models.\n",
    "   - **Configuration**:\n",
    "      - `entry_point`: Path to a custom script, useful for additional preprocessing or unique training workflows.\n",
    "      - `framework_version`: Select XGBoost version, e.g., `\"1.5-1\"`.\n",
    "      - `dependencies`: Specify additional packages through `requirements.txt` to enhance preprocessing capabilities or incorporate auxiliary libraries.\n",
    "   - **Ideal Use Cases**: Tabular data modeling using gradient-boosted trees; cases requiring custom preprocessing or tuning logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`PyTorch` Estimator**\n",

    "## When training takes too long\n",
    "\n",
    "When training time becomes excessive, two main options can improve efficiency in SageMaker:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1: Upgrading to a more powerful instance**  \n",
    "- **Option 2: Using multiple instances for distributed training**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Option 1 is the preferred approach and should be explored first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Upgrade to a more powerful instance (preferred starting point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrading to a more capable instance, particularly one with GPU capabilities, is often the simplest and most cost-effective way to speed up training. Check the [Instances for ML page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/ML_with_AWS_SageMaker/instances-for-ML.html) for guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use a single instance upgrade:  \n",
    "- Dataset size – The dataset is small to moderate (e.g., <10 GB), fitting comfortably within memory.  \n",
    "- Model complexity – XGBoost models are typically small enough to fit in memory.  \n",
    "- Training time – If training completes in a few hours but could be faster, upgrading may help.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrading a single instance is usually the most efficient option. It avoids the communication overhead of multi-instance setups and works well for small to medium datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Use multiple instances for distributed training\n",
    "\n",
    "If upgrading a single instance doesn’t sufficiently reduce training time, distributed training across multiple instances may be a viable alternative. For XGBoost, SageMaker applies only data parallelism (not model parallelism).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XGBoost uses data parallelism, not model parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data parallelism – The dataset is split across multiple instances, with each instance training on a portion of the data. The gradient updates are then synchronized and aggregated.  \n",
    "- Why not model parallelism? – Unlike deep learning models, XGBoost decision trees are small enough to fit in memory, so there’s no need to split the model itself across multiple instances.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How SageMaker implements data parallelism for XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "- When `instance_count > 1`, SageMaker automatically splits the dataset across instances.  \n",
    "- Each instance trains on a subset of the data, computing gradient updates in parallel.  \n",
    "- Gradient updates are synchronized across instances before the next iteration.  \n",
    "- The final trained model is assembled as if it had been trained on the full dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to consider multiple instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple instances makes sense when:  \n",
    "- Dataset size – The dataset is large and doesn't fit comfortably in memory.  \n",
    "- Expected training time – A single instance takes too long (e.g., >10 hours).  \n",
    "- Need for faster training – Parallelization can speed up training but introduces communication overhead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If scaling to multiple instances, monitoring training time and efficiency is critical. In many cases, a single, more powerful instance may be more cost-effective than multiple smaller ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing distributed training with XGBoost in SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In SageMaker, setting up distributed training for XGBoost can offer significant time savings as dataset sizes and computational requirements increase. Here's how you can configure it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select multiple instances**: Specify `instance_count > 1` in the SageMaker `Estimator` to enable distributed training.\n",
    "2. **Optimize instance type**: Choose an instance type suitable for your dataset size and XGBoost requirements \n",
    "3. **Monitor for speed improvements**: With larger datasets, distributed training can yield time savings by scaling horizontally. However, gains may vary depending on the dataset and computation per instance."

    "### Why scaling instances might not show speedup here\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small dataset: With only 892 rows, the dataset might be too small to benefit from distributed training. Distributing small datasets often adds overhead (like network communication between instances), which outweighs the parallel processing benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributed overhead: Distributed training introduces coordination steps that can add latency. For very short training jobs, this overhead can become a larger portion of the total training time, reducing the benefit of additional instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree-based models: Tree-based models, like those in XGBoost, don't benefit from distributed scaling as much as deep learning models when datasets are small. For large datasets, distributed XGBoost can still offer speedups, but this effect is generally less than with neural networks, where parallel gradient updates across multiple instances become efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When multi-instance training helps\n",
    "* Larger datasets: Multi-instance training shines with larger datasets, where splitting the data across instances and processing it in parallel can significantly reduce the training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex models: For highly complex models with many parameters (like deep learning models or large XGBoost ensembles) and long training times, distributing the training can help speed up the process as each instance contributes to the gradient calculation and optimization steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributed algorithms: XGBoost has a built-in distributed training capability, but models that perform gradient descent, like deep neural networks, gain more obvious benefits because each instance can compute gradients for a batch of data simultaneously, allowing faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For cost optimization\n",
    "* Single-instance training is typically more cost-effective for small or moderately sized datasets, while multi-instance setups can reduce wall-clock time for larger datasets and complex models, at a higher instance cost.\n",
    "* Increase instance count only if training time becomes prohibitive even with more powerful single instances, while being mindful of communication overhead and scaling efficiency.\n",

    "- **Environment initialization**: Setting up a SageMaker session, defining roles, and specifying the S3 bucket are essential for managing data and running jobs in SageMaker.\n",
    "- **Local vs. managed training**: Always test your code locally (on a smaller scale) before scaling things up. This avoids wasting resources on buggy code that doesn't produce reliable results.\n",
    "- **Estimator classes**: SageMaker provides framework-specific Estimator classes (e.g., XGBoost, PyTorch, SKLearn) to streamline training setups, each suited to different model types and workflows.\n",
    "- **Custom scripts vs. built-in images**: Custom training scripts offer flexibility with preprocessing and custom logic, while built-in images are optimized for rapid deployment and simpler setups.\n",
    "- **Training data channels**: Using `TrainingInput` ensures SageMaker manages data efficiently, especially for distributed setups where data needs to be synchronized across multiple instances.\n",
    "- **Distributed training options**: Data parallelism (splitting data across instances) is common for many models, while model parallelism (splitting the model across instances) is useful for very large models that exceed instance memory.\n",
