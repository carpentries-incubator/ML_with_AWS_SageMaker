    "## Working with AWS for RAG Experiments \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous episode, we briefly introduced several approaches for implementing RAG in AWS. Here, we are simply selecting a good GPU instance that can handle whatever RAG system we want to build. This approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very easy to understand core on the AWS side of things (just select GPU instance and you're good to move on)\n",
    "- Ideal for learning retrieval and generation steps  \n",
    "- Great for experimentation and debugging  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is **not the most cost‑efficient method**. In upcoming episodes we will introduce more efficient and production‑aligned GPU strategies, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On-demand GPU tasks  \n",
    "- Fully managed asynchronous jobs  \n",
    "- Serverless or streaming LLM inference  \n",
    "- SageMaker batch transform & RAG pipelines  \n",
    "- Embedding jobs that run only when needed  \n",
    "\n",
    "Those techniques bring you closer to best practice for scalable and budget‑friendly research computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember to Shut Down Your AWS Instance**: GPU notebook instances continue billing **even when idle**.  Always:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your work  \n",
    "- Shut down or stop the instance when not in use\n",
    "- Verify the status in the AWS console  \n",
    "\n",
    "This habit prevents accidental ongoing GPU charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview: WattBot RAG on a single notebook GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we build a **minimal but realistic RAG pipeline** from the [WattBot 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/WattBot2025/overview) challenge that runs entirely from a single GPU-backed SageMaker notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Work directly with the WattBot data.**\n",
    "   - Use `train_QA.csv` and `metadata.csv` from the competition dataset.\n",
    "   - Download all referenced PDFs (our RAG corpus) using the URLs in `metadata.csv`.\n",
    "2. **Implement the core RAG steps explicitly in code.**\n",
    "   - Read PDFs, extract per-page text, and attach document metadata.\n",
    "   - Chunk text into overlapping segments suitable for embedding.\n",
    "   - Embed chunks with a sentence-transformer (`thenlper/gte-base`)\n",
    "   - Implement cosine-similarity search over the embedding matrix.\n",
    "3. **Connect to a local Qwen-style generator.**\n",
    "   - Use a quantized 7B model on a GPU-backed instance (e.g., `ml.g5.xlarge`).\n",
    "   - Construct WattBot-style answers that we can compare against `train_QA.csv`.\n",
    "4. **Add an explanation pass.**\n",
    "   - Use an LLM to look at the retrieved evidence, the answer, and citations.\n",
    "   - Generate a short explanation and label the **evidence type**: `[Quote]`, `[Table]`, `[Figure]`, or `[Mixed]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook + dataset setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this episode, we assume you are running on an AWS SageMaker notebook instance with a GPU, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ml.g5.xlarge` (recommended) or\n",
    "- `ml.g4dn.xlarge` (may work with smaller models / more aggressive quantization).\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Instances for ML](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/ML_with_AWS_SageMaker/instances-for-ML.html) for further guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 – Download `data.zip` locally\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the **WattBot 2025** dataset. Download the workshop data archive to your laptop or desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open this link in your browser: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/ML_with_AWS_SageMaker/blob/main/data/data.zip\n",
    "- Save `data.zip` somewhere you can find it easily and unzip the folder contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This archive should include a `data/wattbot/` folder containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `metadata.csv` – index of all WattBot papers.\n",
    "- `train_QA.csv` – labeled questions + ground truth answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 – Create a WattBot S3 bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AWS console:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **S3**.\n",
    "2. Create a new bucket named something like:  \n",
    "   `teamname-yourname-wattbot`\n",
    "3. Keep **Block all public access** enabled.\n",
    "4. Add tags so we can track costs:  \n",
    "   - `Project = your-team-name`  \n",
    "   - `Name = your-name`  \n",
    "   - `Purpose = RAG-demo`\n",
    "5. Once the bucket is created, you'll be brought to a page that shows all of your current buckets (and those on our shared account). We'll have to edit our bucket's policy to allow ourselves proper access to any files stored there (e.g., read from bucket, write to bucket). To set these permissions...\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Click on the name of your bucket to bring up additional options and settings.\n",
    "   b. Click the Permissions tab\n",
    "   c. Scroll down to Bucket policy and click Edit. Paste the following policy, editing the bucket name \"sinkorswim-doejohn-wattbot\" to reflect your bucket's nameAs we did in the \"setting up S3 episode, edit your bucket's policy to include the following:"

    "## Recap and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loaded a small corpus of AI / ML energy papers into our notebook environment.\n",
    "- Split long documents into manageable chunks and cached those chunks to disk so we don’t have to re-run the chunking step every time.\n",
    "- Created vector embeddings for each chunk and used similarity search to retrieve relevant context for a given question.\n",
    "- Used an LLM to generate answers from retrieved context and wrote results out to a CSV for later scoring and analysis.\n",
    "- Handled unanswerable questions with an `is_blank` flag so the system can explicitly say “I don’t know” when the evidence isn’t there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a first pass at a RAG pipeline: it works, but there’s a lot of headroom to improve both accuracy and robustness. Some natural next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase the size/quality of models used for embedding and generation**: Try stronger embedding models (e.g., larger sentence-transformers or domain-tuned embeddings) and more capable LLMs for answer generation, especially if you have GPU budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add a reranking step**: Instead of sending the top-k raw nearest neighbors directly to the LLM, use a cross-encoder or reranker model to re-score those candidates and send only the best ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle figures and tables more carefully**: Many key numbers live in tables, figure captions, or plots. Consider:\n",
    "  - OCR / table-parsing tools (e.g., `pytesseract`, table extractors, PDF parsers).\n",
    "  - Multimodal models that can embed or interpret figures and diagrams, not just text.\n",
    "  - Separate chunking strategies for captions, tables, and main text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enrich chunks with metadata**: Attach metadata like section headings (e.g., *Methods*, *Results*), paper ID, year, or paragraph type. You can:\n",
    "  - Filter or boost chunks by metadata at retrieval time.\n",
    "  - Use metadata in the prompt so the LLM knows where evidence is coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Look for LLMs tuned for scientific literature**: Experiment with models that are explicitly trained or finetuned on scientific text (e.g., arXiv / PubMed) so they:\n",
    "  - Parse equations and technical language more reliably.\n",
    "  - Are less likely to hallucinate when reading dense scientific prose.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you iterate, the goal is to treat this notebook as a baseline RAG “workbench”: you can swap in better models, smarter retrieval strategies, and richer document preprocessing without changing the overall pipeline structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next episodes, we will repeat largely the same exact RAG pipeline using slightly different approaches on AWS (processing jobs and Bedrock).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebook setup**: Start by provisioning a GPU-backed notebook instance\n",
    "  (e.g., `ml.g5.xlarge`) so that both the embedding model and Qwen2.5-7B\n",
    "  can run comfortably.\n",
    "- **Local-first RAG**: For teaching (and small corpora), we avoid an external vector database\n",
    "  and instead perform cosine similarity search over in-memory embeddings.\n",
    "- **Ground-truth units**: The `answer_unit` column is always copied directly\n",
    "  from `train_QA.csv`, never guessed by the LLM.\n",
    "- **Two-stage LLM use**: One call focuses on *answering and citing*; a second,\n",
    "  lighter call produces a short explanation tagged with an evidence type.\n",
    "- **WattBot conventions**: We respect the Kaggle competition format,\n",
    "  using `is_blank` for unanswerable questions and for missing fields.\n",
    "- **Scalability path**: The same logic can later be swapped to FAISS/Chroma\n",
    "  and larger models, while preserving the interface used here.\n",
